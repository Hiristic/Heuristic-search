# Definition
Heuristic search refers to a search strategy that attempts to optimize a problem by iteratively improving the solution based on a given heuristic function or a cost measure. A heuristic search method does not always guarantee to find an optimal or the best solution, but may instead find a good or acceptable solution within a reasonable amount of time and memory space.
